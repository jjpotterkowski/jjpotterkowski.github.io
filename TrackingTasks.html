<p>
A tracking task model should have the standard form shown above, and it should
be stored inside the <i>TrackingTasks</i> package.  It includes one block from
the <i>ForcingFunctions.ReferenceSignals</i>, 
<i>ForcingFunctions.DisturbanceInputs</i>, and 
<i>ControlledElements</i> packages, each connected to the appropriate port of
a <i>ManualController</i> block.   
</p>

<p>
An additional component, the <i>TaskSettings</i> block, must be included.  This
block contains important details of the tracking task: <b>taskDuration</b> is 
the total length of the task; <b>previewTime</b> is the amount of time in advance
to show the target motion; and <b>backgroundVisible</b> determines whether or not 
pursuit (background) information is shown.  The last two parameters are only used
in the user experiment, and not in the parameter tuning or simulation functions.
The <i>TrackingTasks.FromReferences</i> package provides a few manual tracking
tasks from the literature.
