Human control behavior while tracking an unpredictable signal can be modeled 
using tools and techniques from control theory. These models are generally
either structural or algorithmic in nature.  Structural models use explicit
equations and parameters to model human control pathways and the human's 
resulting input-output response.  Algorithmic models use a more implicit
optimal control formulation, where only the human's total response is computed.
This library includes only structural models.

Structural manual controller models have taken many forms, but most include
one or more of the control pathways shown in the above figure.  Nearly all 
controllers include the <i>compensatory</i> pathway, which acts on the error 
between the reference and measured state.  Manual tracking experiments that
display only this error, and not the reference and measured states 
independently, are called compensatory tracking tasks.
</p>

<p>
If the reference state and the measured state are displayed to the human,
then they can be used for the <i>feedforward</i> and <i>pursuit</i> control
actions.  The presence of pursuit information does not guarantee pursuit 
control will be used, and the absence of pursuit information does not guarantee
pusuit control will not be used.  The <i>neuromuscular</i> filter accounts
for the lag imposed by limb dynamics and neuromuscular delays.  The human
senses the filtered input using the <i>proprioceptive</i> pathway, and compares
it to the desired input.
</p>

<p>
Once the human's control input is determined, a <i>disturbance input</i> is 
added.  This can be used for a disturbance rejection task, or to add 
<i>remnant</i> to the controller model.  Remnant accounts for the human's
control input that is not predicted by the model.

Included manual controller models are shown in the above table.  The model
<i>PrecisionOriginal</i> was proposed by McRuer and his colleagues, and various
simplified versions with one of the lead-lag terms removed have been used since
then.  These versions mainly differ in how they represent the human's 
neuromuscular filter.  The <i>MultimodalModel</i> and <i>DescriptiveModel</i>
both include pursuit control, but they have different ways of organizing the 
human's control pathways.  
</p>

<p>
The <i>FeedforwardModel</i> includes feedfoward control.  For this control
pathway, an inverted model of the plant dynamics is needed, and the controller
automatically uses the block <i>ManualTracking.Blocks.FeedForward</i> for this
purpose.  To change the inverse dynamics block, or to make the controller use a
different block, the Modelica file text must be modified manually.
</p>

<p>
Once the controller is selected, the next task is to choose values for
controller parameters.  In the class definitions of each controller, parameters
have a specified minimum and maximum value.  Whenever possible, these values
are based on experimental data from the literature.  Python tools provided with
the <i>ManualTracking</i> library can help select these values -- they are
selected either to yield optimal tracking performance, or the closest fit to 
experimental control behavior.
