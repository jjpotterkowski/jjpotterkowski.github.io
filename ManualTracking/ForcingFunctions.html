In manual tracking experiments, the target's motion is prescribed by a
<i>forcing function</i>.  This function should appear random to prevent the
operator from predicting future behavior of the target, unless the real-world
control task consists of highly predictable signals.  This library, and much 
of manual control theory, focuses on the tracking of unpredictable signals.

From past studies, it has been shown that the sum of 5 or more sine waves is 
unpredictable to human operators (McRuer et al., 1965).  An example summed-sine
forcing function is shown above.  The individual sine waves on the left are
combined to yield the more complicated function on the right.

This package only includes the summed sine wave signal, which is by far the
most common signal used in manual tracking tasks.  Frequency values can be 
either in units of Hz (with <i>SumOfSinesHz</i>), or radians per second 
(with <i>SumOfSinesRadPerSec</i>).  If the user wishes to make a custom
forcing function for either the reference signal or disturbance input, the 
signal must be contained in one block with a single output, and it must be
stored in the appropriate package.  If these rules are violated, the Python
functions will not be able to parse the text of the tracking task.
