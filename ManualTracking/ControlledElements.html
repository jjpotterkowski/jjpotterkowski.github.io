The <i>controlled element</i> is the dynamic response of the cursor to control
input, and it represents the real-world system under human control.  A simple 
mechanical example is shown above.  A rolling cart is attached to ground by a 
damper, and the control input pushes the cart with a force proportional to 
<b>K</b>.  The equivalent controlled-element transfer function is shown in the
right side of the figure.  The cart exhibits a lagged velocity response with
time constant <b>M/b</b> and steady-state velocity <b>K/b</b>.  The units of
these parameters depend on the units chosen for <b>M</b>, <b>b</b>, and 
<b>K</b>.  

<p>
Simple models have been used to capture the primary behavior of certain
degrees of freedom in aircraft, automobiles, and other complicated systems.
Many experiments have used the simplest controlled elements with position,
velocity, and acceleration responses.

<p>
All controlled elements included in the library are shown in the above table.
There are the basic position, velocity, and acceleration responses.  There
are also versions of these basic responses with an added first-order lag, 
making them less responsive at first, but eventually reaching the same
steady-state position/velocity/acceleration.

The unstable <i>FirstOrderDivergent</i> controlled element was used to 
investigate limitations of a human's effective time delay in Jex et al. (1966).
The <i>VelocityFlexibleMode</i> includes a second order mode that can be 
oscillatory.  This controlled element was studied with relatively high damping
in Shirley and Young (1968), and with very low damping in Potter and Singhose
(2013).
